### Beta-Blockers

#### Preface
- Isolated BB overdose is often benign, although there is certain BB's to be aware of as their effects can be profoundly toxic. Propranolol and Sotalol cause significant sodium channel blockade and Sotalol specifically can cause potassium channel blocked and subsequently long QT - Significantly increasing the risk of Torsade's de pointes (TdP).
#### Mechanism
- Beta-blockers competitively bind to beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors found in the central and peripheral cardiovascular system. Upon binding to the receptors beta-blockers decrease the production of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) reducing the effects of catecholamines. This leads to a range of effects including reduction in heartrate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility. Overdose leads to cardiovascular shock and in turn forces the cardiovascular system to use glucose instead of fatty-acids, creating a reduction in ATP. Sotalol and Propranolol cause significant sodium channel blockade. Sotalol has an additive potassium channel inhibition which causes significantly prolonged QTc intervals. Increasing risk of TdP. 
#### Toxicokinetics
- Beta-blockers are rapidly absorbed reaching their peak serum concentrations within 1-3 hours. Propranolol is extremely <ins>lipophilic</ins> which means excretion is often extended in overdose and the elimination half life can be extended significantly.

### Propranolol
Class II antiarrhythmic. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker. Blocks both beta-1 and beta-2. Decreases heart rate, myocardial contractility, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen demand
#### Preparations
- Commonly prescribed at dosages of 10mg-40mg in packets of 100. 
- Often taken 2-3 times daily to achieve maintenance levels of 120mg-320mg daily
#### Overdose
---
- >2g is likely to cause significant toxicity although may cause severe toxicity as low as 1g
	- Bradycardia
	- Hypotension
	- Sodium channel blockade (QRS Widening)
	- Seizure, coma, and delirium
	- CNS Depression
	- Bronchospasm
	- HyperK<sup>+</sup>
	- Hypoglycemia
Toxicity will manifest within 4hrs unless extended release preparation is ingested. 

#### Prehospital treatment
----
Pre hospital treatment is limited and often requires higher clinical assistance. Treatment of hypotension with 20ml/kg of Hartmann's. Adrenaline infusion/transcutaneous pacing. Rapid airway management and consider hyperventilation, although is difficult in the prehospital setting. Reversal of hypoxia is important. ***Acidosis significantly exacerbates sodium channel toxicity.***

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered for sodium channel toxicity. 1mmol/kg with a max dose of 100mmol bolus. This dose is non-significant and repeat doses will be required. Consultation with ACCC is highly recommended for increased dosage administration.

***AMIODARONE IS CONTRAINDICATED***

*Rapid treatment and transport is the gold standard in any significant overdose.*
#### PEARLS
- High Lipophilicity
- Rapidly crosses blood-brain barrier (Seizure, CNS depression, delirium)
- sodium channel blockade
- Causes ⭡ hyperK<sup>+</sup>
- ↓ glucose, hypoglycemia

ECG demonstrating the key features of **Propranolol overdose**
*Note*: This is an ECG of flecainide toxicity - Propranolol will have a slower HR.
- Positive R wave in AVR
- Wide QRS (>100ms)
- 1-st degree AV block
